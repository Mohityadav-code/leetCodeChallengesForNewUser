    <h1>You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

        Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
        
        Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
        
        Notice that you may not slant the container.</h1>
        <h2> Example 1 : 
            <img src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" alt="">
        </br>
        Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        Output: 49
    </br>
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. 
        </br>
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
        </h2>

    console.log(maxarea);

    //here i am getting maximum area but not what is asked 
    // Strategy 
    // here i need to subtract height means boths height should be equal 
    // here i also need to add width as we are going further 
    // index will play important role 
    // var diff = height[i]-height[j]
    // var height =height[i]-diff
    // var width = j - i
